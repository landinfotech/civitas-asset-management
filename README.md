# Civitas Asset Management Application (CAM)
CAM is a GIS-integrated asset management application developed to address the unique needs of Canadaâ€™s small communities. CAM supports a three-phase approach to implementing asset management:

1. Asset Register: Capture asset locations and collect relevant data
2. Asset Prioritization: Prioritize assets based on risk
3. Capital and Operational Strategies: Identify capital projects and operational procedures to manage asset risk.

CAM includes a web-interface for application users and a configured QGIS interface for application technicians. LandInfo Technologies and Kartoza are the official maintainers of CAM.
